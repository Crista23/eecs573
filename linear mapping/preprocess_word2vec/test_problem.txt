a partial memory state save of the fxsave or xsave image or a partial memory state restore of the fxrstor or xrstor image may occur if a memory address exceeds the 64 kb limit while the processor is operating in 16bit mode or if a memory address exceeds the 4 gb limit while the processor is operating in 32bit mode
performance monitor event fp_mmx_trans_to_mmx event cch umask 01h counts transitions from x87 floating point fp to mmx instructions due to this erratum if only a small number of mmx instructions including emms are executed immediately after the last fp instruction a fp to mmx transition may not be counted
due to this erratum enabling memory sparing can result in an internal timer error as indicated by the ia32_mci_statusmcacod of 0000_0100_0000_0000
the processor may livelock when 1 a processor thread has enabled on demand clock modulation via bit 4 of the ia32_clock_modulation msr 19ah and the clock modulation duty cycle is set to 125 02h in bits 30 of the same msr and 2 the other processor thread does not have on demand clock modulation enabled and that thread is executing a stream of instructions with the lock prefix that either split a cacheline or access uc memory
upon delivery of an smi system management interrupt the processor saves and then clears traceen in the ia32_rtit_ctl msr 570h thus disabling intel processor trace intel pt if the smi handler enables intel pt and it remains enabled when an rsm instruction is executed a shutdown event should occur due to this erratum the processor does not shutdown but instead generates a gp generalprotection exception
