if the soc sees more than 189 bytes for a microframe an error will be sent to software and the isochronous transfer will be lost if a single data packet is lost no perceptible impact for the end user is expected note intel has only observed the issue in a synthetic test environment where precise control of packet scheduling is available and has not observed this failure in its compatibility validation testing isochronous traffic is periodic and cannot be retried thus it is considered good practice for software to schedule isochronous transactions to start at the beginning of a microframe known software solutions follow this practice to sensitize the system to the issue additional traffic such as other isochronous transactions or retries of asynchronous transactions would be required to push the inbound isochronous transaction to the end of the microframe
if the rmh returns more data than expected the endpoint will detect packet babble for that transaction and the packet will be dropped since overscheduling occurred to create the error condition the packet would be dropped regardless of rmh behavior if a single isochronous data packet is lost no perceptible impact to the end user is expected note usb software overscheduling occurs when the amount of data scheduled for a microframe exceeds the maximum budget this is an error condition that violates the usb periodic scheduling rule note this failure has only been recreated synthetically with usb software intentionally overscheduling traffic to hit the error condition
if there are no other transactions pending the rmh is unaware a device has entered suspend and may start sending a transaction without waking the device the implication is device dependent but a device may stall and require a reset to resume functionality if there are other transactions present only the initial isochronous transaction may be lost the loss of a single isochronous transaction may not result in end user perceptible impact note intel has only observed this failure when using software that does not comply with the usb specification and violates the hardware isochronous scheduling threshold by terminating transactions that are already in progress
periodic transfers may be delayed or aborted if the asynchronous retry latency causes the periodic transfer to be aborted the impact varies depending on the nature of periodic transfer if a periodic interrupt transfer is aborted the data may be recovered by the next instance of the interrupt or the data could be dropped if a periodic isochronous transfer is aborted the data will be dropped a single dropped periodic transaction should not be noticeable by end user
for lowspeed transactions the extra retrys allow a transaction additional chances to recover regardless of if the fullspeed transaction has errors or not if the fullspeed transactions also have errors the soc may retry the transaction fewer times than required stalling the device prematurely once stalled the implication is software dependent but the device may be reset by software
if the usb driver fully subscribes a usb microframe lsfs transactions may exceed the microframe boundary note no functional failures have been observed
the implication is device dependent a device may experience a delayed transaction stall and be recovered via software or stall and require a reset such as a hot plug to resume normal functionality
