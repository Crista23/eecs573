Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE59	LLC Error Conditions May be Dropped or Incorrectly Signaled
Problem:	When two LLC (last level cache) errors happen in close proximity, a UCNA (uncorrectable no action required) machine check may be dropped or a spurious machine check or CMCI (Corrected Machine Check Interrupt) may be issued. Further, when this erratum occurs, the merged CBo LLC machine check bank IA32_MC[17- 19]_STATUS MSRs may be incorrect.
Implication:	IA32_MC[17-19]_STATUS MSR may not reflect most current error.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a partial workaround for this erratum. The workaround does not address the potential dropped UCNA machine check.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE60	Unexpected System Behavior May Occur Following Virtualization of Some APIC Writes
Problem:	If the “virtual-interrupt delivery” VM-execution control is enabled, unexpected system behavior may occur following virtualization of the MOV to CR8 instruction, memory- mapped accesses to the EOI (End of Interrupt), TPR (Task Priority Register), or the interrupt command register to send an interprocessor interrupt to itself. This erratum does not apply to the corresponding WRMSR access.
Implication:	The unexpected system behavior may result in incorrect instruction execution, EPT (Extended Page Table) violation, page fault, or similar event. These may cause incorrect guest execution or may lead a virtual-machine monitor to terminate the virtual machine that was running at the time.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE61	A DDR4 C/A Parity Error in Lockstep Mode May Result in a Spurious Uncorrectable Error
Problem:	If a memory C/A (Command/Address) parity error occurs while the memory subsystem is configured in lockstep mode then the channel that observed the error will properly log the error but the associated channel in lockstep will incorrectly log an uncorrectable error in its IA32_MCi_STATUS MSR.


Implication:	Due to this erratum, incorrect logging of an uncorrectable memory error in IA32_MCi_STATUS may occur.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE62	Some IMC and Intel QPI Functions Have Incorrect PCI CAPPTR Values
Problem:	The PCI CAPPTR (Capability Pointer Register) is defined to contain the offset to the capabilities list structure when the PCI PCISTS (PCI Status Register) bit 4 (Capabilities_List) is set to 1. Due to this erratum, CAPPTR (offset 0x34) should hold a value of 0x40 but is instead zero for these IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) and Intel® QPI (Intel QuickPath Interconnect) device:
Device 8, functions 3,5,6
Device 9, functions 3,5,6
Device 10, functions 3,5,6
Device 19, functions 0-5
Device 20, functions 0-3
Device 21, functions 0-3
Device 22, functions 0-3
Device 23, functions 0-3
Implication:	Software that depends on CAPPTR to access additional capabilities may not behave as expected.

Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE63	PCIe TLP Translation Request Errors Are Not Properly Logged For Invalid Memory Writes
Problem:	A PCIe Memory Write TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) with an AT field value of 01b (address translation request) does not set the UR (Unsupported Request) bit (UNCERRSTS CSR, Bus 0; Device 0; Function 0; Offset 0x14C; Bit 20) as required by the PCIe Base Specification.
Implication:	System or software monitoring error status bits may not be notified of an unsupported request. When this erratum occurs, the processor sets the 'advisory_non_fatal_error_status' bit (CORERRSTS CSR, Bus 0; Device 0; Function 0; Offset 0x158; Bit 13) and drops the failing transaction.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .

Implication:	Due to this erratum, a system may hang during warm reset. This erratum does not occur if the processor has a single HA or at least one DIMM is installed on memory channel 0 or 1.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE66	PCIe Slave Loopback May Transmit Incorrect Sync Headers
Problem:	The PCIe Base Specification requires that, in the Loopback.Active state, a loopback slave re-transmits the received bit stream bit-for-bit on the corresponding Tx. If the link is directed to enter loopback slave mode at 8 GT/s via TS1 ordered sets with both the Loopback and Compliance Receive bits set, the processor may place sync headers in incorrect locations in the loopback bit stream.
Implication: In PCIe CEM (Card Electromechanical specification) Rx compliance testing directing the link to loopback slave mode, the received data may not be correctly re-transmitted on the Tx, causing the test to fail.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .

Problem:	The Performance Monitor Instructions Retired event (Event C0H; Umask 00H) and the instruction retired fixed counter IA32_FIXED_CTR0 MSR (309H) are used to count the number of instructions retired. Due to this erratum, certain internal conditions may cause the counter(s) to increment when no instruction has retired or to intermittently not increment when instructions have retired.
Implication:	A performance counter counting instructions retired may over count or under count.
The count may not be consistent between multiple executions of the same code.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE72	C/A Parity Error Injection May Cause the System to Hang
Problem:	When C/A (Command Address) parity error injections are occurring too frequently, the home agent may be prevented from completing memory transactions. This may result in an internal timer error indicated by IA32_MCi_STATUS. MSCOD=0x0080 and IA32_MCi_STATUS. MCACOD=0x0400.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the system may hang.
Workaround: Ensure there is at least 30µs of delay between injections. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .

Problem:	Due to this erratum, fan speed control does not correctly account for the thermal profile at elevated operating temperatures.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, fan speed is higher than required unnecessarily increasing fan power consumption and fan noise.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE74	Disabling PCIe Ports Prevents Package C6 Entry
Problem:	The processor’s PCIe links can be disabled by setting the Link Disable bit in the Link Control register (LNKCON.link_disable) (Bus 0; Device 0,1,2,3; Function 0,0-1,0-3,0-3; Offset 0xA0; Bit 4) to 1. Due to this erratum, configuring one or more PCIe ports to be disabled prevents the processor from entering package C6 state.
Implication:	The processor’s inability to reach the Package C6 state will result in increased idle power consumption.
Workaround: None identified. For an optimal processor power configuration, unused PCIe ports should remain enabled.


Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE75	The System May Shut Down Unexpectedly During a Warm Reset.
Problem:	Certain complex internal timing conditions present when a warm reset is requested can prevent the orderly completion of in-flight transactions. It is possible under these conditions that the warm reset will fail and trigger a full system shutdown.

Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .


HSE81	DDR4 CLK Signal May Incorrectly Float During Warm Reset or S3 State
Problem:	The processor may not drive the DDR4 clock signal during warm reset or during S3 State rather than driving the signal low as required by the JEDEC DDR4 specification.
Implication: The anomalous electrical condition of an undriven clock signal can lead to correctable and uncorrectable memory errors (IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD = 0x009n, where n is the channel number) after a warm reset or when resuming from S3 state.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE82	DDR4 Self Refresh Entry May Result in Memory Read Errors
Problem:	The processor may violate the JEDEC power down timing tCPDED parameter specification associated with DDR4 self-refresh entry.

Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE95	PECI Commands During Warm Reset May Lead to an Undefined Machine Check Error
Problem:	After a warm reset request is made, generally by BIOS or in response to a processor error, the processor is not able to accept PECI commands until the subsequent RESET# signal assertion ends. A PECI command during this interval will log an undefined model specific error code of 0x26 in bits[31:24] of the IA32_MCi_STATUS MSR (411H).
Implication:	Due to this erratum, attempts to issue PECI commands to the processor while RESET# is asserted may result in an unexpected error.
Workaround: An external agent that is able to issue PECI commands must not issue PECI commands during the interval from warm reset request to RESET# deassertion.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .


HSE96	Spurious Corrected Errors May be Reported
Problem:	Due this erratum, spurious corrected errors may be logged in the IA32_MC0_STATUS register with the valid field (bit 63) set, the uncorrected error field (bit 61) not set, a Model Specific Error Code (bits [31:16]) of 0x000F, and an MCA Error Code (bits [15:0]) of 0x0005.

HSE102		Performance Monitoring OFFCORE_RESPOSE_{1,2} Events May Miscount L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP
Problem:	When a Performance Monitoring counter is configured to count OFF_CORE_RESPONSE_{1,2} (Events B7H and B8H), data obtained for remote DRAM may be attributed to L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0 (as programmed by MSR_OFFCORE_RSP_{1,2} (MSRs 1A6H, 1A7H) bit 27) instead of L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1 (bit 28) or L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P (bit 29). Data provided from remote caching agent associated with remote DRAM is unaffected.
Implication:	L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0 may over count, while L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1 and L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P may undercount.
Workaround: None identified. Set all three configuration bits (L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0, L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1, L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P) to obtain the total count of data supplied by remote agents.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE103		Memory Power Consumption Reading May Not Be Accurate When Memory Channels Share a VR

Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE108	Some OFFCORE_RESPONSE Performance Monitoring Events May Undercount
Problem:	The performance monitoring events OFFCORE_RESPONSE (Events B7H and BBH) should count uncore responses matching the request-response configuration specified in MSR_OFFCORE_RSPs (1A6H and 1A7H, respectively) for core-originated requests. However due to this erratum, COREWB (bit 3), PF_L3_DATA_RD (bit 7), PF_L3_RFO (bit 8), PR_L3_CODE_RD (bit 9), SPLIT_LOCK_UC_LOCK (bit 10), and STREAMING_STORES (bit 11) request types may undercount.
Implication:	These performance monitoring events may not produce reliable results for the listed request types.
Workaround: None identified
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE109	Enabling ADR with UDIMMs May Result in Unpredictable System Behavior
Problem:	When ADR (Asynchronous DIMM self-Refresh) is enabled during an S3 resume, the processor may cause the UDIMM to prematurely exit self refresh.

Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE110	MTF VM Exit on XBEGIN Instruction May Save State Incorrectly
Problem:	Execution of an XBEGIN instruction while the “monitor trap flag” VM-execution control is 1 will be immediately followed by an MTF VM exit. If advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions has been enabled, the VM exit will erroneously save the address of the XBEGIN instruction as the instruction pointer (instead of the fallback instruction address specified by the XBEGIN instruction). In addition, it will erroneously set bit 16 of the pending-debug-exceptions field in the VMCS indicating that a debug exception or a breakpoint exception occurred.
Implication:	Software using the monitor trap flag to debug or trace transactional regions may not operate properly. Intel has not observed this erratum with any commercially available software.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE111	PEBS Record May Be Generated After Being Disabled

Implication:	A PEBS record generated after a VMX transition will store into memory according to the post-transition DS (Debug Store) configuration. These stores may be unexpected if PEBS is not enabled following the transition.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. A software workaround is possible through disallowing PEBS during VMX non-root operation and disabling PEBS prior to VM entry.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the .
HSE112	MOVNTDQA From WC Memory May Pass Earlier Locked Instructions
Problem:	An execution of (V)MOVNTDQA (streaming load instruction) that loads from WC (write combining) memory may appear to pass an earlier locked instruction that accesses a different cache line.
Implication:	Software that expects a lock to fence subsequent (V)MOVNTDQA instructions may not operate properly.
Workaround: None identified. Software that relies on a locked instruction to fence subsequent executions of (V)MOVNTDQA should insert an MFENCE instruction between the locked instruction and subsequent (V)MOVNTDQA instruction.

HSE114		Some DRAM And L3 Cache Performance Monitoring Events May Undercount
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the supplier may be misattributed to unknown, and the following events may undercount
MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_HIT (Event D1H Umask 04H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_MISS (Event D1H Umask 20H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_MISS (Event D2H Umask 01H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HIT (Event D2H Umask 02H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HITM (Event D2H Umask 04H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_NONE (Event D2H Umask 08H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_MISS_RETIRED.LOCAL_DRAM (Event D3H Umask 01H) MEM_TRANS_RETIRED.LOAD_LATENCY (Event CDH Umask 01H)
Implication:	The affected events may undercount, resulting in inaccurate memory profiles. For the affected events that are precise, PEBS records may be generated at incorrect points. Intel has observed incorrect counts by as much as 20%.
Workaround: None Identified.

HSE115	An x87 Store Instruction Which Pends #PE While EPT is Enabled May Lead to an Unexpected Machine Check and/or Incorrect x87 State Information
Problem:	The execution of an x87 store instruction which causes a #PE (Precision Exception) to be pended and also causes a VM-exit due to an EPT violation or misconfiguration may lead the VMM logging a machine check exception with a cache hierarchy error (IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD = 0150H and IA32_MCi_STATUS.MSCOD = 000FH).
Additionally, FSW.PE and FSW.ES (bits 5 and 7 of the FPU Status Word) may be incorrectly set to 1, and the x87 Last Instruction Opcode (FOP) may be incorrect.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the VMM may receive an unexpected machine check exception and software attempting to handle the #PE may not behave as expected.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected stepping, see the .
HSE116	Interrupt Remapping May Lead to a System Hang
Problem:	Under complex micro-architectural conditions, back-to-back interrupt requests when interrupt remapping is enabled may lead to a system hang.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system hang may be associated with a queued invalidation of the IOAPIC that does not complete.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected stepping, see the .
HSE117	Writing MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP May #GP When Intel® TSX is Not Supported.
Problem:	Due to this erratum, on processors that do not support Intel TSX (Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions) (CPUID.07H.EBX bits 4 and 11 are both zero), writes to MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP (MSR 680H to 68FH) may #GP unless bits[62:61] are equal to bit[47].
Implication:	The value read from MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP is unaffected by this erratum; bits [62:61] contain IN_TSX and TSX_ABORT information respectively. Software restoring these MSRs from saved values are subject to this erratum.
Workaround: Before writing MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP, ensure the value being written has bit[47] replicated in bits[62:61]. This is most easily accomplished by sign extending from bit[47] to bits[62:48].
Status:	For the affected stepping, see the .
HSE118	JTAG Boundary Scan For Intel QPI And PCIe* Lanes May Report Incorrect Stuck at 1 Errors.
Problem:	Boundary Scan testing of the Intel QPI and PCIe interfaces may incorrectly report a recurring stuck at 1 failure on Intel QPI and PCIe receiver lanes. This erratum only affects Boundary Scan testing and does not affect functional operation of the Intel QPI and PCIe interfaces.
Implication:	This erratum may result in Boundary Scan test failures reported on one or more of the Intel QPI and PCIe lanes.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected stepping, see the .


HSE119	APIC Timer Interrupt May Not be Generated at The Correct Time In TSC-Deadline Mode.
Problem:	After writing to the IA32_TSC_ADJUST MSR (3BH), any subsequent write to the IA32_TSC_DEADLINE MSR (6E0H) may incorrectly process the desired deadline. When this erratum occurs, the resulting timer interrupt may be generated at the incorrect time.
Implication:	When the local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) timer is configured for TSC-Deadline mode, a timer interrupt may be generated much earlier than expected or much later than expected. Intel has not observed this erratum with most commercially available software.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected stepping, see the .
