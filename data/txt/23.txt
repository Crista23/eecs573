Problem: Intel® QPI may report an inband reset with no width change (error 0x22) correctable error upon exit from the L1 power state as logged in its IA32_MC{5, 20, 21}_STATUS MSRs (415H,451H,455H).
Implication:	An unexpected inband reset with no width change error may be logged.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX2	PECI DDR DIMM Digital Thermal Reading Returns Incorrect Value
Problem:	When using the PECI RdPkgConfig() command to read PCS (Package Config Space) Service 14 “DDR DIMM Digital Thermal Reading”, the value returned is incorrect.
Implication:	Platform thermal management may not behave as expected. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX3	IIO CSR Lnkcon2 Field Selectable_De_Emphasis Cannot Be Set For DMI2 Mode
Problem:	The CSR lnkcon2 (Bus 0; Device 0; Function 0, Offset 0x1C0) field selectable_de_emphasis (bit 6) cannot be set for a link when the DMI port is operating at 5 GT/s.The documentation has the attribute of RW-O (read, write once), but the processor incorrectly operates as read-only. This erratum does not occur when link is operating as a PCIe* port.
Implication:	When the link is in DMI2 mode, the de-emphasis cannot be changed for an upstream component.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX4	PCIe* Receiver May Not Meet the Specification for AC Common Mode Voltage And Jitter
Problem:	Due to this erratum, PCIe receivers may not meet the specification for AC common mode voltage (300 mV) and jitter (78.1 ps) at high temperatures when operating at 5 GT/s.
Implication:	Specifications for PCIe receiver AC common mode voltage and jitter may not be met. Intel has not observed this erratum on any commercially available system with any commercially available PCIe devices.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX5	Receiver Termination Impedance On PCIe 3.0 Does Not Comply With The Specification
Problem:	The PCIe Base Specification revision 3.0 defines ZRX-HIGH-IMP-DC-NEG and ZRX- HIGH-IMP-DC-POS for termination impedance of the receiver. The specified impedance for a negative voltage (-150 mV to 0V) is expected to be greater than 1 Kohm.
Sampled measurements of this impedance as low as 400 ohms have been seen. The specified impedance for a positive voltage (> 200 mV) is greater than 20 Kohms.


Sampled measurements of this impedance as low as 14.6 Kohms have been seen.
Implication:	Intel has not observed functional failures from this erratum on any commercially available platforms using any commercially available PCIe device.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX6	A Memory Channel With More Than 4 Ranks May Lead to a System Hang
Problem:	A memory controller channel with more than 4 ranks and with TRR (Targeted Row Refresh) enabled may fail leading to a system hang. This erratum only impacts memory channels with three dual-rank DDR4 RDIMMs.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the system may hang.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX7	Writing R3QPI Performance Monitor Registers May Fail
Problem:	Due to this erratum, attempting to write R3QPI performance monitor registers (Bus 0; Device 11; Functions 1,2,5,6; Offset 0xA0-0xF7) may be unsuccessful.
Implication:	A failed write to one or more R3QPI performance monitor registers is likely to yield incorrect performance events counts.
Workaround: Consecutively write the identified registers twice with the same value before performance monitoring is globally enabled.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX8	Intel® QPI Link Re-training After a Warm Reset or L1 Exit May be Unsuccessful
Problem:	After a warm reset or an L1 exit, the Intel® QPI (Intel QuickPath Interconnect) links may not train successfully.
Implication:	A failed Intel® QPI link can lead to reduced system performance or an inoperable system.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX9	VCCIN VR Phase Shedding is Disabled
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the processor does not direct the VCCIN VR (voltage regulator) to shed phases during low power states.
Implication:	Platform power consumption may exceed expected levels during deep package C- states.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX10	PECI Commands During Reset May Result in Persistent Timeout Response
Problem:	Due to this erratum, a PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) command other than GetDIB(), Ping(), or GetTemp() received before RESET_N is de-asserted may result in a timeout (0x81 completion code) for all subsequent such commands.
Implication:	Future PECI commands other than GetDIB(), Ping(), and GetTemp() will not be serviced after this erratum occurs.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.


Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX11	System May Hang When Using the TPH Prefetch Hint
Problem:	When all enabled cores on a socket are simultaneously in core C3, core C6, or package C6 state and a PCIe TPH (Transaction layer packet Processing Hint) with the prefetch hint set is received, the system may hang.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the system may hang.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX12	TS1s Do Not Convey The Correct Transmitter Equalization Values During Recovery.RcvrLock
Problem:	The PCIe 3.1 Base Specification requires that TS1s sent during Recovery.RcvrLock following 8.0 GT/s EQ (adaptive equalization) contain the final transmitter preset number and coefficient values that were requested by an endpoint during phase 2 of EQ. Due to this erratum, TS1s with incorrect transmitter preset number values may be sent during Recovery.RcvrLock following 8.0 GT/s adaptive equalization.
Implication:	Endpoints that check these values may, when unexpected values are found, request equalization restart in subsequent TSs it sends. If EQ requests from the endpoint are supported in the BIOS or OS, EQ will be restarted and the link may continue this EQ loop indefinitely.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX13	MSR_TEMPERATURE_TARGET MSR May Read as '0'
Problem:	Due to this erratum, reading the MSR_TEMPERATURE_TARGET MSR (1A2H) may incorrectly return '0'.
Implication:	Software that depends on the contents of the MSR_TEMPERATURE_TARGET MSR may not behave as expected.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX14	PECI RdIAMSR() Command May Fail After Core C6 State is Entered
Problem:	Reading core Machine Check Bank registers using the PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) RdIAMSR() command may fail after core C6 state has been entered.
Implication:	Invalid data may be returned when using PECI to read core Machine Check Bank registers.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX15	CLTT May Cause BIOS To Hang On a Subsequent Warm Reset
Problem:	If CLTT (Closed Loop Thermal Throttling) is enabled when a warm reset is requested, due to this erratum, the processor will resume DIMM temperature polling before the memory sub-system has been re-initialized.
Implication:	This erratum may lead to a BIOS hang. The warm reset request will fail, along with subsequence warm reset attempts. The failing condition is cleared by a cold reset.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX16	PCIe* Extended Tag Field May be Improperly Set
Problem:	The Extended Tag field in the TLP Header will not be zero for TLPs issued by PCIe ports 1a, 1b, 2c, 2d, 3c, and 3d even when the Extended Tag Field Enable bit in the Device Control Register (Offset 08H, bit 8) is 0.
Implication:	This does not affect ports 0, 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b. This will not result in any functional issues when using device that properly track and return the full 8-bit Extended Tag value with the affected ports. However, if the Extended Tag field is not returned by a device connected to an affected port then this may result in unexpected completions and completion timeouts.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX17	A MOV to CR3 When EPT is Enabled May Lead to an Unexpected Page Fault or an Incorrect Page Translation
Problem:	If EPT (extended page tables) is enabled, a MOV to CR3 or VMFUNC may be followed by an unexpected page fault or the use of an incorrect page translation.
Implication:	Guest software may crash or experience unpredictable behavior as a result of this erratum.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX18	Memory Controller tsod_present Settings Being Improperly Cleared
Problem:	On single Home Agent configurations, due to this erratum, the processor interferes with TSOD (thermal sensor on DIMM) usage by incorrectly clearing the tsod_present field (bits[7:0]) of the smbcntl_1 CSR (Bus 0; Device 19; Function 0; Offset 0x198) after BIOS writes that field.
Implication:	Closed Loop Thermal Throttle will not work as expected. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX19	DDR4 Power Down Timing Violation
Problem:	When DDR4 is operating at 2133 MHz, the processor’s memory control may violate the JEDEC tPRPDEN timing specification.
Implication:	Violation of timing specifications can lead to unpredictable system behavior; however, Intel has not observed this erratum to impact the operation of any commercially available system using validated DIMMs by Intel Platform Memory Operations.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX20	Correctable Memory ECC Errors May Occur at Boot
Problem:	With memory lockstep enabled, the system may experience correctable memory errors during boot with IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD= 0x009x (where x is 0,1,2, or 3 and indicates the channel number reporting the error)
Implication:	The system may experience correctable memory errors. 
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX21	BT Timeouts May Cause Spurious Machine Checks
Problem:	The BT (Backup Tracker) timeout logic in the Home Agent can trigger spuriously, causing false machine checks indicated by IA32_MCi_STATUS.MSCOD=0x0200.


Implication:	Due to this erratum, timeout machine check may occur. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX22	PCIe Type 1 VDMs May be Silently Dropped
Problem:	Due to this erratum, a PCIe Type 1 VDMs (Vendor Defined Message) is silently dropped unless the vendor ID is the MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol) value of 0x1AB4.
Implication:	PCIe Type 1 VDMs may be unexpectedly dropped. Intel has not observed this erratum to impact the operation of any commercially available system.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX23	CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL CSR Implemented at Incorrect Offset
Problem:	The PCIe Base Specification indicates that Configuration Space Headers have a base address register at offset 0x10. Due to this erratum, the Power Control Unit’s CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL CSR (Bus 1; Device 30; Function 3; Offset 0x10) is located where a base address register is expected.
Implication:	Software may treat the CONFIG_TDP_NOMINAL CSR as a base address register leading to a failure to boot.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX24	A Machine-Check Exception Due to Instruction Fetch May Be Delivered Before an Instruction Breakpoint
Problem:	Debug exceptions due to instruction breakpoints take priority over exceptions resulting from fetching an instruction. Due to this erratum, a machine-check exception resulting from the fetch of an instruction may take priority over an instruction breakpoint if the instruction crosses a 32-byte boundary and the second part of the instruction is in a 32-byte poisoned instruction fetch block.
Implication:	Instruction breakpoints may not operate as expected in the presence of a poisoned instruction fetch block.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX25	Power Consumed During Package C6 May Exceed Specification
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the processor power usage may be higher than specified for the VCCIN and/or IIO domains while in Package C6 state.
Implication:	Systems may experience increased power consumption while the processor is in Package C6.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX26	Platform Performance Degradation When C1E is Enabled
Problem:	Due to this erratum, when C1E is enabled and after the processor has entered Package C1E state, core clock frequency becomes limited to its minimum value (sometimes referred to as Pn) until the system exits Package C3 state (or deeper) or the system is reset.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, operating frequency will be lower than expected.


Note:	After a Package C3 exit, re-entering Package C1E state re-imposes this erratum’s frequency limit.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX27	PCIe Correctable Error Status Register May Not Log Receiver Error at
8.0 GT/s
Problem:	Due to this erratum, correctable PCIe receiver errors may not be logged in the DPE field (bit 15) of the PCISTS CSR (Bus: 0; Device 1,2,3; Function 0-1, 0-3, 0-3; Offset 6H) when operating at 8.0 GT/s.
Implication:	Correctable receiver errors during 8.0 GT/s operation may not be visible to the OS or driver software.
Workaround:  None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX28	PCIe Hot-Plug Slot Status Register May not Indicate Command Completed
Problem:	The PCIe Base Specification requires a write to the Slot Control register (Offset A8H) to generate a hot plug command when the downstream port is hot plug capable. Due to this erratum, a hot plug command is generated only when one or more of the Slot Control register bits [11:6] are changed.
Implication:	Writes to the Slot Control register that leave bits [11:6] unchanged will not generate a hot plug command and will therefore not generate a command completed event.
Software that expects a command completed event may not behave as expected.
Workaround: It is possible for software to implement a one-second timeout in lieu of receiving a command completed event.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX29	Local PCIe P2P Traffic on x4 Ports May Cause a System Hang
Problem:	Under certain conditions, P2P (Peer-to-Peer) traffic with x4 PCIe ports on the same processor (i.e., local) may cause a system hang.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the system may hang.
Workaround: None identified. Local P2P traffic should not be used to or from x4 PCIe ports. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX30	ILLC Error Conditions May be Dropped or Incorrectly Signaled
Problem:	When two LLC (last level cache) errors happen in close proximity, a UCNA (uncorrectable no action required) machine check may be dropped or a spurious machine check or CMCI (Corrected Machine Check Interrupt) may be issued. Further, when this erratum occurs, the merged CBo LLC machine check bank IA32_MC[17- 19]_STATUS MSRs may be incorrect.
Implication:	IA32_MC[17-19]_STATUS MSR may not reflect most current error.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a partial workaround for this erratum. The workaround does not address the potential dropped UCNA machine check.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX31	A DDR4 C/A Parity Error in Lockstep Mode May Result in a Spurious Uncorrectable Error
Problem:	If a memory C/A (Command/Address) parity error occurs while the memory subsystem is configured in lockstep mode then the channel that observed the error will properly


log the error but the associated channel in lockstep will incorrectly log an uncorrectable error in its IA32_MCi_STATUS MSR.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, incorrect logging of an uncorrectable memory error in IA32_MCi_STATUS may occur.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX32	Some IMC and Intel QPI Functions Have Incorrect PCI CAPPTR Values
Problem:	The PCI CAPPTR (Capability Pointer Register) is defined to contain the offset to the capabilities list structure when the PCI PCISTS (PCI Status Register) bit 4 (Capabilities_List) is set to 1. Due to this erratum, CAPPTR (offset 0x34) should hold a value of 0x40 but is instead zero for these IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) and Intel® QPI (QuickPath Interconnect) device:
Device 8, functions 3,5,6
Device 9, functions 3,5,6
Device 10, functions 3,5,6
Device 19, functions 0-5
Device 20, functions 0-3
Device 21, functions 0-3
Device 22, functions 0-3
Device 23, functions 0-3
Implication:	Software that depends on CAPPTR to access additional capabilities may not behave as expected.
Workaround: Software that needs to access these capabilities must take this erratum into account. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX33	PCIe TLP Translation Request Errors Are Not Properly Logged For Invalid Memory Writes
Problem:	A PCIe Memory Write TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) with an AT field value of 01b (address translation request) does not set the UR (Unsupported Request) bit (UNCERRSTS CSR, Bus 0; Device 0; Function 0; Offset 0x14C; Bit 20) as required by the PCIe Base Specification.
Implication:	System or software monitoring error status bits may not be notified of an unsupported request. When this erratum occurs, the processor sets the 'advisory_non_fatal_error_status' bit (CORERRSTS CSR, Bus 0; Device 0; Function 0; Offset 0x158; Bit 13) and drops the failing transaction.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX34	Consecutive PECI RdIAMSR Commands When Core C6 is Enabled May Cause a System Hang
Problem: Consecutive PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) RdIAMSR commands to access core Machine Check MSRs can result in a system hang when core C6 state is enabled.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, PECI commands can lead to a system hang.


Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX35		Enabling TRR With DDR4 LRDIMMs May Lead to Unpredictable System Behavior
Problem:	Due to this erratum, TRR (Targeted Row Refresh) is not compatible with DDR4 LRDIMMs.
Implication:	Unpredictable system behavior may occur.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX36	C/A Parity Error Injection May Cause the System to Hang
Problem:	When C/A (Command Address) parity error injections are occurring too frequently, the home agent may be prevented from completing memory transactions. This may result in an internal timer error indicated by IA32_MCi_STATUS. MSCOD=0x0080 and IA32_MCi_STATUS. MCACOD=0x0400.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the system may hang.
Workaround: Ensure there is at least 30 µs of delay between injections. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX37	The System May Shut Down Unexpectedly During a Warm Reset.
Problem:	Certain complex internal timing conditions present when a warm reset is requested can prevent the orderly completion of in-flight transactions. It is possible under these conditions that the warm reset will fail and trigger a full system shutdown.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system will shut down and all machine check error logs will be lost.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX38	Patrol Scrubbing of Mirrored Memory May Log Spurious Memory Errors
Problem:	The Patrol scrubber, when mirroring is enabled, may incorrectly identify certain data patterns as poison data or as memory errors.
Implication:	Spurious memory errors and poisoned data may be logged when mirroring is enabled.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX39	MSR_TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO MSR Cannot be Locked
Problem:	Setting the TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO_LOCK field (bit 31) of the MSR_TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO MSR (64CH) has no effect; it does not block future writes to the MSR_TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO MSR.
Implication:	Software cannot rely on locking MSR_TURBO_ACTIVATION_RATIO MSR. 
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX40	The System May Shut Down Unexpectedly During a Warm Reset
Problem:	Certain complex internal timing conditions present when a warm reset is requested can prevent the orderly completion of in-flight transactions. It is possible under these conditions that the warm reset will fail and trigger a full system shutdown.


Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system will shut down and all machine check error logs will be lost.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX41	Invalid Intel® QuickData Technology XOR Descriptor Source Addressing May Lead to Unpredictable System Behavior
Problem:	Intel® QuickData Technology (i.e. Crystal Beach DMA v3.2) does not correctly halt and report aborts on illegal source addresses placed in a CBDMA descriptor regardless of type (Legacy or PQ). This abort condition may cause unpredictable system behavior.
Implication:	This erratum may lead to unpredictable system behavior.
Workaround: Ensure XOR DMA descriptor source addresses targets valid DRAM memory locations. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX42	Warm Reset May Cause PCIe Hot-Plug Sequencing Failure
Problem:	The Integrated I/O unit uses the VPP (Virtual Pin Port) to communicate with power controllers, switches, and LEDs associated with PCIe Hot-Plug sequencing. Due to this erratum, a warm reset occurring when a VPP transaction is in progress may result in an extended VPP stall, termination of the in-flight VPP transaction, or a transient power down of slots subject to VPP power control.
Implication:	During or shortly after a warm reset, when this erratum occurs, PCIe Hot-Plug sequencing may experience transient or persistent failures or slots may experience unexpected transient power down events. In certain instances, a cold reset may be needed to fully restore operation.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX43	PCIe* UR And CA Responses May be Sent Before Link Enters LER State
Problem:	Completions with UR (Uncorrectable Response) and CA (Completer Abort) status should trigger LER (Live Error Recovery). Further, these packets should be dropped upon entering LER. Due to this erratum, these completions may not be dropped when LER is triggered.
Implication:	Since these packets contain no data, there is no loss of error containment. These packets will trigger LER mode; the link will be disabled.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX44	Surprise Down Error Status is Not Set Correctly on DMI Port
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the Surprise_down_error_status (UNCERRSTS Device0; Function); Offset 0x14C; bit5) is not set to 1 when DMI port detects a surprise down error.
Implication:	Surprise down errors will not be logged for the DMI port. This violates the PCIe* Base Specification. Software that relies on this status bit may not behave as expected.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX45	Intel SMI2 in Half Width Mode With DDDC Enabled Will Not Report RdECC Errors
Problem:	When a RdECC error occurs on an Intel SMI2 channel operating at a 1:1 ratio half-width mode and DDDC (Dual Device Data Correction) enabled, the error logging in the Intel® C102/104/112/114 Scalable Memory Buffer and the processor is not properly coordinated.


Implication:	Although the error flow is correct, error isolation may be affected because the processor may log a RdECC error while the Intel C102/104/112/114 Scalable Memory Buffer does not log an error.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX46	PCIe* SLTCON CSRs electromechanical_interlock_control Field Read as 1
Problem:	The PCI Express Base Specification rev 3.1 requires that the SLTCON (Bus 0;Device 3- 0;Function 3-0;Offset 0xA8) CSRs’ electromechanical_interlock_control (bit 11) “always returns aa 0 when read”. Due to this erratum, a read of this bit returns the last value written.
Implication:	Software expecting a value of 0 may not function as expected. Intel has not observed this erratum to impact the operation of any commercially available software.
Workaround: Software should ignore read values returned from this register field. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX47	Intel DDR3 SMI2 CAP Errors Are Ignored Leading to Unpredictable System Behavior
Problem:	An Intel SMI2 DDR3 CAP (Command Address Parity) error, rather than initiating a mirroring event as expected, is ignored leading to unpredictable system behavior.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, it may lead to unpredictable system behavior. Note that this behavior does not affect DDR4 memory subsystems.
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain processor configuration data and code changes as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX48	PECI RdPkgConfig Command DRAM Services May Behave Incorrectly
Problem:	The PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) RdPkgConfig command may return incorrect results when accessing the DRAM Thermal Interface (indices 14 and 22).
Implication:	Thermal monitoring and control using PECI may not behave as expected. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX49	Some OFFCORE_RESPONSE Performance Monitoring Events May Undercount
Problem:	The performance monitoring events OFFCORE_RESPONSE (Events B7H and BBH) should count uncore responses matching the request-response configuration specified in MSR_OFFCORE_RSPs (1A6H and 1A7H, respectively) for core-originated requests. However due to this erratum, COREWB (bit 3), PF_L3_DATA_RD (bit 7), PF_L3_RFO (bit 8), PR_L3_CODE_RD (bit 9), SPLIT_LOCK_UC_LOCK (bit 10), and STREAMING_STORES (bit 11) request types may undercount.
Implication:	These performance monitoring events may not produce reliable results for the listed request types.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX50	Performance Monitoring OFFCORE_RESPOSE_{1,2} Events May Miscount L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP
Problem:	When a Performance Monitoring counter is configured to count OFF_CORE_RESPONSE_{1,2} (Events B7H and B8H), data obtained for remote DRAM may be attributed to L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0 (as programmed by MSR_OFFCORE_RSP_{1,2} (MSRs 1A6H, 1A7H) bit 27) instead of L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1 (bit 28) or L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P (bit 29). Data provided from remote caching agent associated with remote DRAM is unaffected.
Implication:	L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0 may over count, while L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1 and L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P may undercount.
Workaround: None identified. Set all three configuration bits (L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP0, L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP1, L3_MISS_REMOTE_HOP2P) to obtain the total count of data supplied by remote agents.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX51	Some DRAM and L3 Cache Performance Monitoring Events May Count Incorrectly
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the supplier information may become stale, and the following events may count incorrectly:
MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_HIT (Event D1H Umask 04H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_MISS (Event D1H Umask 20H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_MISS (Event D2H Umask 01H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HIT (Event D2H Umask 02H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HITM (Event D2H Umask 04H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_NONE (Event D2H Umask 08H) MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_MISS_RETIRED.LOCAL_DRAM (Event D3H Umask 01H) MEM_TRANS_RETIRED.LOAD_LATENCY (Event CDH Umask 01H) PAGE_WALKER_LOADS.DTLB_L3 (Event BCH Umask 14H) PAGE_WALKER_LOADS.ITLB_L3 (Event BCH Umask 24H)
PAGE_WALKER_LOADS.DTLB_Memory (Event BCH Umask 18H) PAGE_WALKER_LOADS.ITLB_Memory (Event BCH Umask 28H)
Implication:	The affected events may count incorrectly, resulting in inaccurate memory profiles. For the affected events that are precise, PEBS records may be generated at incorrect points. Intel has observed incorrect counts by as much as 40%.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX52	Certain Settings of VM-Execution Controls May Result in Incorrect Linear-Address Translations
Problem:	If VM exit occurs from a guest with primary processor-based VM-execution control “activate secondary controls” set to 0 and the secondary processor-based VM- execution control “enable VPID” set to 1, then after a later VM entry with VPID fully enabled (“activate secondary controls” and “enable VPID” set to 1), the processor may use stale linear address translations.
Implication:	The processor may incorrectly translate linear addresses. Intel has not observed this erratum with any commercially available software.
Workaround: Software should not enter a guest with “enable VPID” set to 1 when “activate secondary controls” is set to 0.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX53	An IRET Instruction That Results in a Task Switch Does Not Serialize The Processor
Problem:	An IRET instruction that results in a task switch by returning from a nested task does not serialize the processor (contrary to the Software Developer’s Manual Vol. 3 section titled “Serializing Instructions”).
Implication:	Software which depends on the serialization property of IRET during task switching may not behave as expected. Intel has not observed this erratum to impact the operation of any commercially available software.
Workaround: None identified. Software can execute an MFENCE instruction immediately prior to the IRET instruction if serialization is needed.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX54	A P-State or C-State Transition May Lead to a System Hang
Problem:	For a small subset of parts under elevated die temperature conditions, a P-state or C- state transition may result in a system timeout or system shutdown.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system may shutdown or report a timeout error; Intel has observed transaction completion timeouts and other internal timeouts.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX55	PECI Frequency Limited to 1 MHz
Problem:	The PECI (Platform Environmental Control Interface) 3.1 specification’s operating frequency range is 0.2 MHz to 2 MHz. Due to this erratum, PECI may be unreliable when operated above 1 MHz.
Implication:	Platforms attempting to run PECI above 1 MHz may not behave as expected. 
Workaround: None identified. Platforms should limit PECI operating frequency to 1 MHz.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX56		VGATHERQPS That Loads an Element From The APIC-Access Page May Load Other Elements From Incorrect Addresses
Problem:	If the “virtualize APIC accesses” VM-execution control is 1, a 256-bit VGATHERQPS with an element that maps to the APIC-access page may use incorrect addresses to load other elements.
Implication:	Loading from an incorrect address can result in unexpected behavior with respect to data, faults or VM exits. This erratum will occur only if a guest operating system attempts to access the APIC using the VGATHERQPS instruction. Intel has not observed this erratum with any commercially available software.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX57	A Spurious Patrol Scrub Error May be Logged
Problem:	When a memory ECC error occurs, a spurious patrol scrub error may also be logged on another memory channel.
Implication:	A patrol scrub correctable error may be incorrectly logged. 
Workaround: None Identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX58	DRAM Device Failure With Error Flow Registers Enabled May Result in a Machine Check
Problem:	During a high rate of correctable DRAM error events, a DDR4 CAP (command/address parity) error may result in an unrecoverable machine check with an IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD (bits [15:0]) value of 0000 0000 100x xxxx (where x can be 0 or 1) and an IA32_MCi_STATUS.MSCOD (bits [31:16]) value of 0x0200 or with an IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD value of 0000 0001 xxxx xxxx and an IA32_MCi_STATUS.MSCOD value of 0x000C.
Implication:	A high rate of correctable errors, typically the result of a DRAM device failure, may result in an unrecoverable machine check.
Workaround: A BIOS code change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX59	MTF VM Exit on XBEGIN Instruction May Save State Incorrectly
Problem:	Execution of an XBEGIN instruction while the “monitor trap flag” VM-execution control is 1 will be immediately followed by an MTF VM exit. If advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions has been enabled, the VM exit will erroneously save the address of the XBEGIN instruction as the instruction pointer (instead of the fallback instruction address specified by the XBEGIN instruction). In addition, it will erroneously set bit 16 of the pending-debug-exceptions field in the VMCS indicating that a debug exception or a breakpoint exception occurred.
Implication:	Software using the monitor trap flag to debug or trace transactional regions may not operate properly. Intel has not observed this erratum with any commercially available software.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX60	PEBS Record May Be Generated After Being Disabled
Problem:	A performance monitoring counter may generate a PEBS (Precise Event Based Sampling) record after disabling PEBS or the performance monitoring counter by clearing the corresponding enable bit in IA32_PEBS_ENABLE MSR (3F1H) or IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSR (38FH).
Implication:	A PEBS record generated after a VMX transition will store into memory according to the post-transition DS (Debug Store) configuration. These stores may be unexpected if PEBS is not enabled following the transition.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. A software workaround is possible through disallowing PEBS during VMX non-root operation and disabling PEBS prior to VM entry.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX61	PCIe* Ports Do Not Support DLL Link Active Reporting
Problem:	The PCIe Base Specification requires every “Downstream Port that supports Link speeds greater than 5.0 GT/s” to support DLL (Data Link Layer) Link Active Reporting, However, the PCIe ports do not support DLL Link Active Reporting.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the PCIe ports do not support DLL Link Active Reporting. This may be reported by a PCIe compliance test.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX62	PCIe* Link Speed Negotiation May Fail After Link is Re-enabled
Problem:	If a PCIe link is established then disabled and the link partner’s advertised speeds are changed while the link is disabled, the link may fail to correctly negotiate link speed when it is re-enabled.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, the PCIe link speed negotiation may fail after re-enabling a disabled port.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX63	PROCHOT# Assertion During Warm Reset May Cause Persistent Performance Reduction
Problem:	Assertion of PROCHOT# after RESET# de-assertion but before BIOS has completed reset initialization (indicated by CPL3) may result in persistent processor throttling. Asserting PROCHOT# during and after RESET# assertion for FRB (Fault Resilient Boot) tri-stating of the processor is not affected by this erratum.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the resultant persistent throttling substantially reduces the processor’s performance.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX64	Data Breakpoint Coincident With a Machine Check Exception May be Lost
Problem:	If a data breakpoint occurs coincident with a machine check exception, then the data breakpoint may be lost.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, a valid data breakpoint may be lost. 
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX65	A Corrected Internal Parity Error May Result in a System Hang
Problem:	A corrected Internal Parity Error (IA32_MC0_STATUS.MCACOD=0005H and IA32_MC0_STATUS.MSCOD=000FH, MSR 401H bits [15:0] and bits [31:16]
respectively) may cause a system hang.
Implication:	Due to this erratum, a corrected internal parity error may cause a system hang. Reset, SMI, or INIT will end the system hang.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX66	IA32_MC0_STATUS May be Incorrect After a Machine Check Overflow
Problem:	When an SRAR (Software Recoverable Action Required) error is logged in IA32_MC0_STATUS (MSR 401H), a subsequent fatal error will correctly set the PCC (bit
57) and OVER (bit 62) flags but may fail to update other fields in IA32_MC0_STATUS.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the error logged in IA32_MC0_STATUS is an invalid mixture of an SRAR error with the PCC flag set. Software that reads IA32_MC0_STATUS may not behave as expected.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX67	IA32_MC1_STATUS.MISCV May be Incorrect on a Machine Check Overflow
Problem:	If software writes machine check bank 1 to contain a valid UC error with IA32_MC1_STATUS.MISCV cleared, another UC machine check may set IA32_MC1_STATUS.MISCV in violation of the overwrite rules.
Implication:	When there is a machine check overflow in MC1, the IA32_MC1_STATUS.MISCV cannot be relied upon to indicate that IA32_MC1_MISCV is valid. All UC errors in MC1 will set MISCV.
Workaround: Software should not write UC errors into IA32_MC1_STATUS with IA32_MC1_STATUS.MISCV=0. Software may write IA32_MC1_MISC=0 to indicate no valid data in IA32_MC1_MISC.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX68	PEBS EventingIP Field May Be Incorrect Under Certain Conditions
Problem:	The EventingIP field in the PEBS (Processor Event-Based Sampling) record reports the address of the instruction that triggered the PEBS event. Under certain complex microarchitectural conditions, the EventingIP field may be incorrect.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, performance monitoring software may not attribute the PEBS events to the correct instruction.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX69	RF May be Incorrectly Set in The EFLAGS That is Saved on a Fault in PEBS or BTS
Problem: After a fault due to a failed PEBS (Processor Event Based Sampling) or BTS (Branch Trace Store) address translation, the RF (resume flag) may be incorrectly set in the EFLAGS image that is saved.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, a code breakpoint on the instruction following the return from handling the fault will not be detected. This erratum only happens when the user does not prevent faults on PEBS or BTS.
Workaround: Software should always prevent faults on PEBS or BTS.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX70	An APIC Timer Interrupt During Core C6 Entry May be Lost
Problem:	Due to this erratum, an APIC timer interrupt coincident with the core entering C6 state may be lost rather than held for servicing later.
Implication:	A lost APIC timer interrupt may lead to missed deadlines or a system hang. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX71	MOVNTDQA From WC Memory May Pass Earlier Locked Instructions
Problem:	An execution of (V)MOVNTDQA (streaming load instruction) that loads from WC (write combining) memory may appear to pass an earlier locked instruction that accesses a different cache line.
Implication:	Software that expects a lock to fence subsequent (V)MOVNTDQA instructions may not operate properly.
Workaround: None identified. Software that relies on a locked instruction to fence subsequent executions of (V)MOVNTDQA should insert an MFENCE instruction between the locked instruction and subsequent (V)MOVNTDQA instruction.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.


HSX72	An x87 Store Instruction Which Pends #PE While EPT is Enabled May Lead to an Unexpected Machine Check and/or Incorrect x87 State Information
Problem:	The execution of an x87 store instruction which causes a #PE (Precision Exception) to be pended and also causes a VM-exit due to an EPT violation or misconfiguration may lead the VMM logging a machine check exception with a cache hierarchy error (IA32_MCi_STATUS.MCACOD = 0150H and IA32_MCi_STATUS.MSCOD = 000FH).
Additionally, FSW.PE and FSW.ES (bits 5 and 7 of the FPU Status Word) may be incorrectly set to 1, and the x87 Last Instruction Opcode (FOP) may be incorrect.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the VMM may receive an expected machine check exception and software attempting to handle the #PE may not behave as expected.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX73	Load Latency Performance Monitoring Facility May Stop Counting
Problem:	The performance monitoring events MEM_TRANS_RETIRED.LOAD_LATENCY_* (Event CDH; UMask 01H; any latency) count load instructions whose latency exceed a predefined threshold, where the loads are randomly selected using the Load Latency facility (PEBS extension). However due to this erratum, load latency facility may stop counting load instructions when Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) is enabled.
Implication:	Counters programmed with the affected events stop incrementing and do not generate PEBS records.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX74	Certain PerfMon Events May be Counted Incorrectly When The Processor is Not in C0 State
Problem:	Due to this erratum, the PerfMon events listed below may be counted when the logical processor is not in C0 State.
IDQ.EMPTY (Event 79H, Umask 02H) IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED.CORE (Event 9CH, Umask 01H) RESOURCE_STALLS.ANY (Event A2H, Umask 01H)

Adding the following 3 events to existing erratum: CYCLE_ACTIVITY.CYCLES_LDM_PENDING (Event A3H, Umask 02H, Cmask 02H) CYCLE_ACTIVITY.CYCLES_NO_EXECUTE (Event A3H, Umask 04H, Cmask 04H) CYCLE_ACTIVITY.STALLS_LDM_PENDING (Event A3H, Umask 06H, Cmask 06H)
Implication:	The count will be higher than expected. 
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX75	Writing MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP May #GP When Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel® TSX) is Not Supported
Problem:     Due to this erratum, on processors that do not support Intel TSX (CPUID.07H.EBX bits 4 and 11 are both zero), writes to MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP (MSR 680H to 68FH) may #GP unless bits[62:61] are equal to bit[47].
Implication:	The value read from MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP is unaffected by this erratum; bits [62:61] contain IN_TSX and TSX_ABORT information respectively. Software restoring these MSRs from saved values are subject to this erratum.


Workaround: Before writing MSR_LASTBRANCH_x_FROM_IP, ensure the value being written has bit[47] replicated in bits[62:61]. This is most easily accomplished by sign extending from bit[47] to bits[62:48].
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX76	JTAG Boundary Scan For Intel® QuickPath Interconnect (Intel® QPI) and PCIe* Lanes May Report Incorrect Stuck at 1 Errors
Problem:	Boundary Scan testing of the Intel QPI and PCIe interfaces may incorrectly report a recurring stuck at 1 failure on Intel QPI and PCIe receiver lanes. This erratum only affects Boundary Scan testing and does not affect functional operation of the Intel QPI and PCIe interfaces.
Implication:	This erratum may result in Boundary Scan test failures reported on one or more of the Intel QPI and PCIe lanes.
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
HSX77	APIC Timer Interrupt May Not be Generated at The Correct Time In TSC-Deadline Mode
Problem:	After writing to the IA32_TSC_ADJUST MSR (3BH), any subsequent write to the IA32_TSC_DEADLINE MSR (6E0H) may incorrectly process the desired deadline. When this erratum occurs, the resulting timer interrupt may be generated at the incorrect time.
Implication:	When the local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) timer is configured for TSC-Deadline mode, a timer interrupt may be generated much earlier than expected or much later than expected. Intel has not observed this erratum with most commercially available software.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	For the affected steppings, see the Summary Tables of Changes.
