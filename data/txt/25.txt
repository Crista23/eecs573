KNL1.	Cacheable MMIO requests may block PCIe* memory requests in SMM mode
Problem:	When operating in SMM mode, cacheable MMIO requests may prevent PCIe memory requests from completing.
Implication:	If PCIe memory requests are blocked by cacheable MMIO requests, the system may hang.
Workaround: Do not issue cacheable MMIO request during SMM mode. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL2.	DdrCrClkTraining CSR Cannot Be Read
Problem:      Due to this erratum, two fields in DdrCrClkTraining CSR (Bus: 2; Device:17; Function: 5; Offset: A1Ch), that should have been read-write, VmseLogicDelay0 (bit 29) and VmseLogicDelay2 (bit 30), are write-only; reading the CSR always returns 0s for these fields.
Implication:	Data read from this register is not reliable. Intel has not observed this erratum to affect processor functionality.
Workaround: None identified. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL3.	Performance Monitoring Event NO_ALLOC_CYCLES Counts Incorrectly on Logical Processors 2 and 3
Problem: Due to this erratum, all sub-events of  performance  monitoring  event  NO_ALLOC_CYCLES (Event CAH) will be incorrect on logical processors 2 and 3. Logical processors 0 and 1 are not affected by this erratum.
Implication:	Using the NO_ALLOC_CYCLES performance monitoring event on logical processors 2 or 3 will not provide reliable results.
Workaround: Use the results of the NO_ALLOC_CYCLES performance monitoring event only when running the workload on logical processors 0 and/or 1.
Status:	No Fix
KNL4.	A and/or D Bit May Be Set on a Paging-Structure Entry That is Not Present or Has Reserved Bit Set
Problem: The A (Accessed, bit 5) and/or D (Dirty, bit 6) bits in a paging-structure entry (e.g., a Page-Table Entry) may be set to 1 even when that entry has its Present bit cleared or has a reserved bit set. This can only occur when one logical processor has cleared the Present bit or set a reserved bit in a paging-structure entry, while at the same time another logical processor accesses the contents of a linear address mapped by that entry.
Implication:	Software that does not expect hardware to modify a paging-structure entry when it is marked not present, or has a reserved bit set, may behave unexpectedly.
Workaround: Operating systems can take steps to ensure they are not exposed to this erratum.
Contact your Intel representative for further information.
Status:	No Fix

KNL5.	PCI Express Inbound Memory Write With RO and NS Attributes Set Will Cause the Processor to Hang
Problem:    Inbound memory writes with the RO (Relaxed Ordering) and NS (No Snoop) attributes set in the TLP will cause the processor to hang.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system will experience a hang. 
Workaround: BIOS should disable relaxed ordering for inbound transactions. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL6.	CLTT PECI Pass-Through Mode Does Not Work
Problem: When CLTT (Closed Loop Thermal Throttling) PECI Pass-through mode is enabled, PECI thermal update messages are dropped.
Implication: Integrated Memory Controller does not receive thermal data from the PECI update messages.
Workaround: Do not use CLTT PECI Pass-through mode for DDR throttling. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL7.	Uncorrectable Memory Machine Check May Not Set IA32_MC3_STATUS.EN
Problem: When an uncorrectable memory error follows a correctable memory error,  the error  logged may not set the EN field (bit 60) in the IA32_MC3_STATUS MSR (40CH).
Implication: An uncorrectable machine check may be logged with EN incorrectly set to 0, possibly leading to unexpected machine check handler behavior.
Workaround: None Identified. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL8.	Package C6 May Cause Incorrect APIC Timer Value
Problem: The APIC timer CCR (Current Count Register)  may be too  high after waking from  package C6. The next timer interrupt will be delivered at the correct time. However, in Periodic mode, the reload of the APIC timer may be delayed.
Implication: When this erratum occurs, CCR reads may be too high and in Periodic mode an APIC timer interrupt may occur later than expected.
Workaround: None Identified. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL9.	Unsynchronized Cross-Modifying Code Operations Can Cause Unexpected Instruction Execution Results
Problem: The act of one processor or system bus master writing data into a currently executing  code segment of a second processor with the intent of having the second processor execute that data as code is called cross-modifying code (XMC). XMC that does not force the second processor to execute a synchronizing instruction prior to execution of the new code is called unsynchronized XMC. Software using unsynchronized XMC to modify the instruction byte stream of a processor can see unexpected or unpredictable execution behavior from the processor that is executing the modified code.
Implication: In this case the phrase “unexpected or unpredictable execution behavior” encompasses the generation of most of the exceptions listed in the Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual Volume 3: System Programming Guide including a General Protection Fault (GPF) or other unexpected behaviors. In the event that unpredictable execution causes a GPF the application executing the unsynchronized XMC operation would be terminated by the operating system.





Workaround: In order to avoid this erratum programmers should use the XMC synchronization algorithm as detailed in the Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual Volume 3: System Programming Guide, Section: Handling Self- and Cross-Modifying Code.
Status:	No Fix
KNL10.	Upper 48 Bits of the Scatter/Gather Mask Register do Not Function as Expected
Problem:   When one element of a scatter or gather instruction faults, the upper 48 bits of the   mask register will be cleared. Ideally, only bits corresponding to completed operations should be cleared.
Implication: Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)  instructions supported by  KNL use only the lower 16 bits of these mask registers. Intel has not observed this erratum to affect commercially available software.
Workaround: None Identified 
Status:	No Fix
KNL11.	DR6 May be Zero After Data Breakpoint on Gather, Scatter or VRSQRT14 Instructions
Problem: If gather, scatter or VRSQRT14 instructions trigger a data breakpoint, the Debug Status Register (DR6) may be cleared.
Implication: Software will see a breakpoint trap but with no indication of which data breakpoint register was triggered.
Workaround: None Identified. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL12.	Performance Monitoring Event CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD_P Counts Incorrectly on Counter 1 If AnyThread Bit is Set For Counter 0
Problem: Due to this erratum, GP (general-purpose) counter 1 may overcount CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD_P (Event 3CH Umask 00H) if
IA32_PERFEVTSEL0.AnyThread (MSR 186H, bit 21) is set.
Implication:	CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD_P event should not be relied upon on GP counter 1. 
Workaround: Use only GP counter 0 or fixed counter 1 for unhalted core cycles.
Status:	No Fix
KNL13.	An Instruction With7or More Prefixes May Cause a Spurious #PF or Spuriously Read UC Memory
Problem:   An instruction with 7 or more prefixes can result in a spurious code fetch that may   signal a #PF (Page Fault) or read UC (un-cacheable) memory.
Implication:	A spurious UC memory access may result in unexpected and undesired side effect(s).
The OS may mishandle a spurious #PF due to there being no reason for the #PF
Workaround: Avoid using 7 or more prefixes on an instruction. If limiting the number of prefixes is not feasible then marking MMIO (memory mapped I/O) as XD (execute disable) in the page tables will prevent speculative reads from UC MMIO.
Status:	No Fix

KNL14.	Machine Check Exception MSCOD is Incorrect For Poisoned Case
Problem: When poisoned data is received at the EDC, MSCOD should be logged as a data error (encoding = 0x2). Instead, the encoding is set for an uncorrectable error (0x40). The effected machine check bank registers are IA32_MC7_STATUS through IA32_MC14_STATUS.
Implication:	Error reporting for poisoned data is incorrectly reported as an uncorrected error and not a data error. The error flow will be incorrect for poisoned data.
Workaround: None Identified. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL15.	POC_RESET_STRAPS CSR Does Not Report Correct Values
Problem:	The POC_RESET_STRAPS CSR (Bus: 1; Device 30; Function 1; Offset: A0H) does not correctly report the strap settings.

Workaround: A BIOS workaround has been identified. Contact Intel representative for more information.
Status:	No Fix
KNL16.	Invalid VEX Instructions May Not Signal a #GP
Problem:	Under certain conditions, invalid VEX instructions with prefixes may not signal a #GP. Implication:	Processor may not operate as expected with invalid VEX instructions.
Workaround: None Identified.
Status:	No Fix
KNL17.	Performance Monitoring OvfUncore Capability is Not Functional
Problem: Due to this erratum, IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS.OvfUncore (MSR 38EH, bit[61]) is always 0 and writing 1 to IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL.ClrOvfUncore (MSR 390H, bit[61]) signals #GP.
Implication:	Software attempting to use OvfUncore capability may not function as expected. 
Workaround: None identified.
Status:	No Fix
KNL18.	PECI PCS (Package Configuration Space) Read For Max Thread ID is Incorrect
Problem:	The PECI command RdPkgConfig (Index 0) with Data Max Thread ID always returns a value of 0x12F regardless of the number of tiles enabled.
Implication:	This PECI command does not report an accurate Max Thread ID.
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain processor configuration data and code changes as a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	No Fix
KNL19.	BIST Results Always Indicate BIST Failure
Problem:	BIST results in BIST_RESULTS_CFG_2 (Bus 0, Device 8, Function1, Offset 0xB8, bits [5:0]) returns 0 regardless of actual BIST status.
Implication:	BIST results in BIST_RESULTS_CFG_2 are incorrect.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	No Fix

KNL20.	Incorrect Linear-Address Translation May Be Used for Instruction Fetch
Problem: Under complex micro-architectural conditions when MT  is active,  operations  which  should invalidate instruction TLB entries may fail to do so. This may lead a later instruction fetch using a stale linear address translation.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the processor may use incorrect translations, This may result in unexpected faults or other unpredictable system behavior.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL21.	Accesses Between TOHM and 2^45 - 1 May Lead to Unpredictable System Behavior
Problem:     A CPU access to addresses at or above TOHM (Top  of High Memory) as configured in  the TOHM CSR (Bus: 0; Device: 5; Function: 0; Offset: D8h) and below 2^45 may lead to unpredictable system behavior when the L1 data prefetcher is enabled.
Implication:	Unpredictable system behavior may occur.
Workaround: This address range inclusively between TOHM and 2^45 - 1 should be marked as not present in page or EPT tables and not used. Alternatively, MSR_MISC_FEATURE_CONTROL.L1_DATA_PREFETCH_DISABLE (MSR 01A4H, bit 0)
can be set to 1 to disable the L1 data prefetcher.
Status:	No Fix
KNL22.	System May Hang When Loading a Second Microcode Update
Problem:	System may hang during warm reset with a PCU_MC_STATUS.MCCOD = 0x0402 and PCU_MC_STATUS. MSEC_FW = 0x9C or 0x9E.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system may hang during a warm reset. 
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	No Fix
KNL23.	Programmatic and PECI SMBus Access May Not Work as Intended
Problem:    When BIOS locks access to SMBCNTL_0 (Bus 1; Device 30; Function 0; Offset 108H)  and SMBCNTL_1 (Bus 1; Device 30; Function; Offset 108H), programmatic access outside SMM and PECI access may not be able to select their intended SMBus devices.
Implication:	SMBus transactions will reference the previously addressed devices.
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain a partial mitigation for this erratum that enables PECI access to change the unlocked portions of SMBCNTL_0 and SMBCNTL_1.
Status:	No Fix
KNL24.	System May Hang During Warm Reset
Problem:	System may hang during warm reset with a PCU_MC_STATUS.MCCOD = 0x0402 and PCU_MC_STATUS. MSEC_FW = 0x9C or 0x9E.
Implication:	When this erratum occurs, the system may hang during a warm reset. 
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	No Fix

Problem: Operating the processor with DDR4 memory configured to operate at 2400 MT/s may cause unpredictable system behavior.
Implication:	When the erratum occurs, the system will exhibit unpredictable system behavior. 
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum.
Status:	No Fix
KNL26.	Enabling DDR Opportunistic Self Refresh May Lead to Memory Errors
Problem: Correctable and uncorrectable memory errors may occur when DDR opportunistic self- refresh is enabled.
Implication: The system may experience a higher rate of memory errors when DDR opportunistic self-refresh is enabled, potentially leading to a system crash.
Workaround: It is possible for BIOS to contain code changes to work around this erratum. 
Status:	No Fix
KNL27.	Certain Memory Controller Uncorrectable Errors Do Not Signal a Machine Check
Problem:    Uncorrectable errors logged into the IA32_MCi_STATUS registers for bank 7 to bank 16 do not signal a machine check exception if the error cause was CA Parity, Data Parity, or Byte En Parity (MSCOD value of 0001H, 0002H, or 0004H, respectively).
Implication: The system may continue execution after encountering an uncorrectable error instead  of responding to a machine check exception. Uncorrectable errors may lead to unpredictable system behavior.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. Implementing this workaround will cause signaling of IERR# instead of MCERR# when this uncorrectable error occurs. There may be an increased delay in error reporting.
Status:	No Fix
KNL28.	PCC is Not Set For Certain Memory Controller Uncorrectable Errors When Poison is Enabled
Problem: PCC field (bit[57]) of IA32_MCi_STATUS registers for bank 7 to bank 16 is not set as expected for a CA Parity error (MSCOD value of 0001H) when Poison is enabled.
Implication: The machine check handlers incorrectly log the error as an Uncorrectable Error with No Action, instead of logging an Uncorrectable Error and signaling a machine check exception.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. Implementing this workaround will cause signaling of IERR# when this uncorrectable error type occurs, in addition to the machine check exception. There may be an increased delay in error reporting.
Status:	No Fix

KNL29.	Memory Controller Machine Check Errors May be Incorrectly Logged
Problem:	UC (Uncorrectable) errors logged into the IA32_MCi_STATUS registers for bank 7 to bank 16 will not indicate PCC=1 (Processor Context Corrupt, bit 57) and OVER=1 (bit
62) if the error is overwriting a previous UCNA (Uncorrected No Action Required) error.
Implication:  The system may continue execution after encountering an uncorrectable error instead of responding to a machine check exception. Uncorrectable errors may lead to unpredictable system behavior.
Workaround: It is possible for the BIOS to contain a workaround for this erratum. Implementing this workaround will cause signaling of IERR# instead of MCERR# when this uncorrectable error occurs. There may be an increased delay in error reporting.
Status:	No Fix
